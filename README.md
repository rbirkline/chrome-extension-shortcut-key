# chrome-extension-shortcut-key

This is a project I did for a friend and was kind of a fun experiment.  The extension works by watching for the Ctrl+Shift+Z keys to be pressed.  Once pressed the local storage is accessed within the extension and plays a sound.

## How to test yourself.

1. Download the extension for Chrome.
2. Go to "More Tools" > "Extensions" and enable "Developer Mode"
3. Click on "Load unpacked"
4. Select the folder for where the unpacked extension is.

## Special thanks

I used Flaticon for all of the images used in this project.
